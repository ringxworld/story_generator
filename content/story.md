## Premise

A city discovers its history was rewritten by a hidden council.

## Chapter 1 - The Missing Ledger

Rhea notices that her brother no longer exists in official records, and every archived reference has been re-indexed under anonymous identifiers.

## Chapter 2 - Audit at Dusk

As Rhea pushes deeper, institutional resistance escalates and she must decide whether Ion is an ally or a controlled leak from inside the archive.

## Open Threads

- Who initiated the records rewrite?
- Why was Rhea's brother targeted?
- Is Ion protecting the truth or managing it?
