# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately before public disclosure.

- Preferred: open a private security advisory on GitHub.

Include:

- affected component and version/commit
- reproduction steps or proof-of-concept
- impact assessment
- suggested mitigation if available

## Response Expectations

- Initial acknowledgement target: within 7 days
- Triage and severity assessment after acknowledgement
- Coordinated disclosure after fix is available

## Scope

Security-relevant areas include:

- dependency and packaging workflow
- CI/CD and deployment workflows
- native bindings and memory safety boundaries
- ingestion pipeline handling untrusted network data
