# story_gen

`story_gen` treats narrative development like software engineering:

- define canon and dependencies up front
- enforce quality gates to prevent drift
- iterate with reproducible workflows

## Current direction

- Build a durable story model around chapters, themes, and characters.
- Add a separate "good essay mode" with explicit policy constraints and draft checks.
- Learn craft patterns from reference analysis without redistributing source texts.
- Keep automation strict so rapid iteration does not degrade architecture.
