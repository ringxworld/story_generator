A story engineering project for building original fiction with discipline.

We are treating storytelling like a software system: define canon, model dependencies, validate continuity, and evolve chapters without drift.

Live reference site:

## Current Stage

- Build the core story engine around themes, chapters, characters, and canon.
- Use reference-text analysis to learn craft patterns (structure, dialogue, pacing, character pressure).
- Turn those patterns into reusable constraints for original story generation.

## What This Project Is Optimizing For

- Narrative consistency over long arcs
- Intentional character voice and relationship evolution
- Clear chapter-level objectives and dependency tracking
- Repeatable workflow from draft to validated chapter

## Working Principles

- Canon is explicit and versioned.
- Drift checks are automated and test-backed.
- Reference material is for private study, not redistribution.
- Every change should move us toward a reliable, high-quality story pipeline.

## Focus Areas

- Story model and planning architecture: `docs/dependency_charts.md`
- Reference ingestion + analysis workflow: `docs/reference_pipeline.md`
