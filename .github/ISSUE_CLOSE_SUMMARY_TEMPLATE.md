# Work Summary

## Objective
Resolve `<issue scope>` in `<component/system>` while preserving `<explicit non-goals>`.

## Root Cause
Identified the fault introduced by `<change/event>` due to `<technical mechanism>`. Confirmed scope is limited to `<component>` and not a downstream dependency defect.

## Approach
- Audited flow from `<entry point>` through `<modules>`.
- Chose `<decision>` over `<alternative>` because `<tradeoff>`.
- Implemented the fix in `<files/modules>` without public API changes.

## Implementation Details
- `<PR/commit reference>`: `<core change>`.
- `<PR/commit reference>`: `<test coverage / guardrail>`.
- `<PR/commit reference>`: `<refactor or cleanup>`.

## Validation
- Added/updated tests for `<primary cases>` and `<edge cases>`.
- Verified compatibility with `<dependents/interfaces>`.
- Confirmed no regression via `<metric/tool/check>`.

## Ownership / Follow-ups
- Change is contained within `<project/component ownership>`.
- External action required: `<none or specific owner/action>`.
- Deferred work tracked in `<issue URL or N/A>`.
